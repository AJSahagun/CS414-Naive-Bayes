Overview
This project is part of the CS414 course, focusing on the implementation and evaluation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks. The project specifically targets Android malware detection using a dataset of app traffic data points. This repository provides the code to preprocess the data, handle class imbalance, and train a Naive Bayes classifier to classify benign and malicious Android applications.
