# CS414-Naive-Bayes
# READ ME 

# Overview
This project is part of the CS414 course, focusing on the implementation and evaluation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks. The project specifically targets Android malware detection using a dataset of app traffic data points. This repository provides the code to preprocess the data, handle class imbalance, and train a Naive Bayes classifier to classify benign and malicious Android applications.


# Project Structure

Dataset/: Contains the datasets used for training and testing. The main dataset, sampled_450.csv, consists of Android application data with multiple features for identifying malware types.
Naive_Bayes/: Contains the main Python script, naive_bayes_script.py, to run the Naive Bayes model.

# Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
  
#Install the necessary libraries by running:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
